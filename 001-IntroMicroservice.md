## Microservices: definition

![[001.jpg]]

Unfortunately, there is no universally acknowledged definition for the term _microservice_. In the context of this course the following definition will be used:

> **Microservices** are independently deployable modules.

For example, an **e-commerce system** can be divided into modules for:

-   ordering
-   registration
-   product search

Normally, all of these modules would be implemented together in one application. In this case, **a change in one of the modules** can only be brought into production by bringing a **new version of the entire application** with all its modules into production. However, when the modules are implemented as microservices, the ordering process cannot only be **changed independently of the other modules**, but it can even be brought into production independently.

This speeds up deployment and reduces the number of necessary tests since only a single module needs to be deployed. Due to this greater level of decoupling, a large project can turn into a number of smaller projects. Each project is in charge of an individual microservice.

To achieve this at the technical level, **every microservice has to be an independent process**. A better solution for decoupling microservices is to provide an independent virtual machine or Docker container for each microservice.

In that case, a deployment will replace the Docker container of an individual microservice with a new Docker container, which starts the new version and its direct requests. The other microservices will not be affected if such an approach is used.

An e-commerce system can be divided into modules as above
## Advantages of this microservice definition
The definition of microservices as independently deployable modules has several advantages:

It is very _compact_.

It is very _general_ and covers all kinds of systems which are commonly denoted as microservices.

The definition is based on modules and is thus a well-understood concept. This allows us to adopt many ideas concerning modularization. This definition also highlights that microservices are part of a larger system and cannot function entirely on their own. Microservices have to be integrated with other microservices.

The independent deployment is a feature that creates numerous advantages and is therefore very important. Thus, the definition, in spite of its brevity, explains what the most essential feature of a microservice really is.

## Deployment monolith
**A system that is not made up of microservices** can only be deployed in its entirety. Therefore, it is called a deployment monolith. Of course, a deployment monolith can be divided into modules. The term deployment monolith does not make a statement about the internal structure of the system.

## Size of a microservice
The above definition of microservices does not say anything about the size of a microservice. Of course, the term microservice suggests that especially small services are meant. However, in practice, microservices **can vary hugely in size**. Some microservices keep an entire team busy, while others comprise only a few hundred lines of code. Thus, the size of microservices is ill-suited to be part of the definition.

## Chapter walkthrough
This chapter introduces microservices and discusses:

- Advantages and disadvantages of microservices to enable the reader to evaluate the applicability and usefulness of this architecture for a specific project.

- The discussion of benefits explains which problems microservices can solve and how this architecture can be adapted for different scenarios.

- The discussion of disadvantages illustrates where technical challenges and risks lie and how these can be addressed.
- Recognizing advantages and disadvantages is critical for technology and architecture decisions since those have to be aimed at maximizing benefits and reducing disadvantages.
